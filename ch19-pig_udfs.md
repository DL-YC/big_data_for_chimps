# Chapter 19: Pig UDFs

Up til now we've avoided writing any Java. Sometimes -- for performance, to use a powerful library, or to interface with an outside system -- Java is the best choice.

When this happens around the office, we sing this little dirge [1]:

    Life, sometimes, is Russian Novel. Is having unhappy marriage and much snow and little vodka.
    But when the Russian Novel it is short, then quickly we finish and again read Sweet Valley High.

What we *don't* do is write a pure Hadoop-API Java program. There's poor reusability.


Instead, assemble your program by implementing a Pig `LoadFunc`/`StoreFunc` or `UDF`.


### Pig UDFs



### LoadFunc / StoreFunc



### Algebraic UDFs let Pig go fast



### Wonderdog -- an ElasticSearch UDF

[1] If the novel lasts all week, someone will tell this joke and then we will walk carefully to the bar.

    The church, it is close by -- but the way is cold and icy.
    The bar, it is far away -- but we shall walk carefully.
