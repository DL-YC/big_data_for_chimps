* Go in order of topic (as below) or of how-to-thinkness? 

=== Munging

* Wikipedia
  - (DL) corpus 
  - (DL) pagelinks
  - (DL) Pageview Counts
  - (DBpedia info)
* Flight Stats
* Weather (hourly? daily?)
* Logs
  - World Cup
  - Star Wars Kid

DL:

* pageview stats
* (redirected)
* parse corpus
  - figure out splitter
  - make it be one line per file (by `&#XX;`'ing the newlines
  - recover / add interesting metadata
* Logs
  - figure out apache log parser in pig
* page links
  - X prepare
  - label category pages, redirect, etc
  - adjacency list + minimal metadata & labelled low-id-first edge list
  - calculate degree (in, out, symmetric) & other simple stats, add to page metadata table.
