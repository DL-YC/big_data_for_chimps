## Who this book is not for

This is not "Hadoop the Definitive Guide" (that's been written, and well); this is more like "Hadoop: a Highly Opinionated Guide". 

It does not cover the Java API at all, except to say "In most cases, don't use it".

It makes claims like "Do not bother to learn about how Pig optimizes your 

It has a relentless emphasis on writing *scalable* code, but no content on writing *performant* code. If you want your program to run twice as fast, launch twice as many machines. 

This is for Big data, not Huge data. Things change when you're past say 50 TB. 

## How this book is being written

I plan to push chapters to the publicly-viewable ['Hadoop for Chimps' git repo](http://github.com/infochimps-labs/big_data_for_chimps) as they are written, and to post them periodically to the [the Infochimps blog](http://blog.infochimps.com) after minor cleanup.

We really mean it about the github thing -- please [comment](https://github.com/blog/622-inline-commit-notes) on the text, [file issues](http://github.com/infochimps-labs/big_data_for_chimps/issues) and send pull requests. 

However! We might not use your feedback, no matter how dazzlingly cogent it is. Also, we are soliciting comments from readers, but not seeking out collaborators. Do not run off and craft a dazzlingly lucid explanation far excelling whatever hackish tripe I would have coughed out and then expect us to include it[^1]. I have strong opinions about what the book should cover and a fixed budget of pages; and while I am trying my hand at author, I have no interest in being an editor. Don't prepare original content unless you get in touch first.

[^1] Do craft dazzlingly lucid explanations, though! Always! And tell us about it -- we won't use it for the book, but we'd probably enjoy linking to it.

* "Big Data for Chimps" or "Hadoop for Chimps"?
* Can we get a Chimpanzee for the cover animal?
