== Big Data for Chimps ==
=== A Seriously Fun guide to Hadoop and Terabyte-scale data processing ===

==== Outline ====

1. **Chimpanzee and Elephant Save Christmas**
  - stream of disordered records
  - group/sort records by their label
  - process each group of records
  
2.  **Heraclitus and the Stream**
  - Simple disordered stream (map-only) in Wukong
  - Simple ordered-group transform (map+reduce) in Wukong
  
3.  **Why Hadoop Works**
  - the locality problem
  - the Hadoop haiku
  - robots are inexpensive, programmers are not

5.  **Herding `cat`s: the mechanics of wrangling massive data**
  - getting data within Hadoop's reach
  - launching jobs
  - seeing the data
  - seeing the logs
  - simple debugging
  - wu-lign

6. **Data Formats**

7. **Semi-structured Data**

  - Wikipedia
    - Datasets:
      - Full-text of Articles (`wikipedia_articles`)
      - Wikipedia Page properties (`wikipedia_pageinfos`)
      - Wikipedia Pagelinks (`wikipedia_links`)
      - Pageview Counts (`wikipedia_pageviews`)
      - (Page Properties from DBpedia) (`wikipedia_dbpedia`)
    - Scripts
      - `parse_raw_articles` (xml splitter, xml parser)
      - `parse_raw_links` (sql dump)
      - `parse_pageinfos` (sql dump)
      - `parse_raw_pageviews` (simple tsv load)
      - `prepare_articles`
      - `prepare_links`
  - Airline Flights and Flight Delays
    - Datasets:
      - Airline Flights with delay information (`airline_flights/flights`)
      - Airlines (`airline_flights/airlines`)
      - Airports (`airline_flights/airports`)
      - Airplanes (`airline_flights/airplanes`)
    - Scripts:
      - `parse_raw_wikipedia_identifiers`
      - `parse_raw_openflights_airports`
      - `parse_raw_dataexpo_airports`
      - `prepare_timezone_mapping`
      - `parse_dataexpo_flights`
      - `reconcile_airports`
      - `timezoneize_flights`
  - Global Weather
    - Daily observations (`weather/daily_observations`)
    - Hourly observations (`weather/hourly_observations`) (we'll only use one of daily vs hourly)
    - Weather stations (`weather/weather_stations`)
  - Logs
    - World Cup (`weblogs/worldcup_apachelogs`)
    - Star Wars Kid (`weblogs/starwarskid_apachelogs`)

6.  **Statistics**
  - sum, average, standard deviation, etc (airline_flights, )
  - medians and percentiles
  - construct a histogram
  - normalize data by mapping to percentile
  - normalize data by mapping to Z-score
  
7.  Advanced Pig
  - map-side join
  - merge join
  - skew joins
  - Performance and efficiency
  
8.  Processing Text
  - grep'ing for simple matches
  - tokenize text
  - simple document analysis
  - minhash clustering
  
9.  Geo Data
  - quadkeys and grid coordinate system
  - k-means clustering to produce readable summaries
  - partial quad keys for "area" data
  - voronoi cells to do "nearby"-ness
  - Using polymaps to see results
10.  Processing Graphs
  - subuniverse extraction
  - Pagerank
  - identify strong links
  - clustering coefficient
11.  Black-Box Machine Learning
  - Simple Naive Bayes classification
  - Document clustering
12.  Flume and Stream Processing
  - sources, sinks and decorators
  - deploying a wukong script as a decorator
  - parse the twitter stream API feed
13.  Time Series
  - windowing
  - simple anomaly detection
  - rolling statistics
14.  Pig UDFs
  - Basic UDF
  - why algebraic is awesome and how to be algebraic
  - Wonderdog: a LoadFunc / StoreFunc for elasticsearch 
15.  Installing and Operating a Cluster
16.  Tuning
17.  HBase and Databases
  
4.  How to Scale Dirty and its Influence on People
  - How to think at scale
