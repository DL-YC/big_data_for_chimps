=== Chimpanzee and Elephant Save Christmas (pt 1) ===

It was holiday time at the North Pole, and letters from little boys and little girls all over the world flooded in as they always do. But this year there was a problem: the world had grown, and the elves just could not keep up with the scale of requests. Luckily, their friends at the Elephant & Chimpanzee Data Shipment Company were available to simplify the process.

=== A Non-scalable approach ===

To meet the wishes of children from every corner of the earth, each elf specializes in a certain kind of toy, from Autobot to Pony to X-box.

As bags of mail arrived from every town and city, they were hung from the branches of the Bag Tree (B-Tree for short). Each time an elf was ready for the next letter, a big claw arm swung out to the right spot on the B-Tree to retrieve it. "The locality of access is all wrong!" bellowed the chimps. "The next request for Lego is as likely to be from Cucamonga as from Novosibirsk, and letters can't be pulled from the tree any faster than the crane arm can move!"

What's worse, all the letters were centralized, but the elves' workstations were not. The hallways were clogged with frazzled elves running back and forth between their workbenches and the B-Tree. The elves spent almost as much effort on the mechanics of retrieving letters as they did making toys. "Throughput, not Latency!" trumpeted the elephants. "For hauling heavy loads, you need a stately elephant parade, not a swarm of frazzled elves!"

=== Letters to Toy Requests ===

In marched the chimps and elephants, who (singing a rather bawdy version of the Map-Reduce Haiku) built the following system.

As you might guess from the last chapter, they lined up a finite number of chimpanzees at a finite number of typewriters to read each letter. The elephants mustered to distribute the bags of mail not in a centralized place, but all across the processing stations -- the same approach describe in the last chapter.

The chimps' job was to take letters one-by-one from a mailbag, and fill out a toyform for each requested toy. The toyform had was labelled prominently by the type of toy, and contained all the information you'd expect (Name, Goodness, Location, etc.). Some simplified examples:

        --------------------------------------         # Joe is clearly a good kid, and thoughtful for his sister. He will get a robot and his sister will get a doll.

        Deer SANTA                                     robot | type="optimus prime" recipient="Joe"
                                                       hat   | type="girls small"  recipient="Joe's sister Julia"
        I wood like an optimus prime robot
        and a hat for my sister julia

        I have been good this year

        love joe


        --------------------------------------          # Frank is a jerk. He will get coal.

        HEY SANTA I WANT A PONY AND NOT ANY             coal  | type="anthracite" recipient="Frank" reason="doesn't like to read"
        DUMB BOOKS THIS YEAR

        FRANK

        ---------------------------------------         # Spam, no action

        Greetings to you Mr Claus, I came to know
        of you in my search for a  reliable and
        reputable person to handle a very confidential
        business transaction, which involves the
        transfer of a huge sum of money...

=== Toyform Delivery ===

In the new system, each type of toy request is handled at the single workbench designated for that toy.  For example, all robots and model cars might go to workbench A, while ponies and yo-yos went to workbench B, and coal to workbench C.

Here's where we come to something new, that wasn't part of the simple translation project.

Next to each chimpanzee stands a line of pygmy elephants, one for each workbench, with a file folder on its back. The chimp places each toyform into the right spot within the right file folder, as fast as its dexterous fingers can file. Once the chimp is done with a mailbag, the elephants march off to the workbench they serve, and behind them a new line of elephants trundle into place.

=== Toy Assembly ===

Finally, the elves. Each workstation might handle several types of toys in a factory run, but always in a continuous batch: the workbench for ponies and scarves will see all the ponies first, and then all the scarves. This is of great help to the elves, as the set-up for tying ribbons on Ponies is very different from the set-up for hand-folding scarves.

	Doll	Purple Hair	Julia    	Anchorage	AK, USA
        Doll	Purple Hair	Royal   	Dallas  	TX, USA
	Doll	Rosy Cheeks	Wei Ju		Shenzen	        China
	...
	Coal	Anthracite	Jim		Mountain View	CA

The finished toys go into large sacks for santa to deliver.

=== Sorted Groups ===

Recall that each elephant carries the work orders destined for one workstation. What's more, on the back of each pygmy elephant is a vertical file like you find at a very organized person's desk:

image::images/paper_sorter.jpg[paper sorter]

Earlier, I mentioned that the chimps place the toyforms into the file folders, but skipped past an important detail. You've seen that receiving all the toyforms for Dolls in a single batch make the elves more efficient. The elves requested that the toyforms be further grouped within each batch: so that all the dolls with "purple hair" arrive in a run, followed by dolls with "rosy cheeks", and so forth.

// Chimpanzees file each toy request in the order of Santa's path through the world. This is easy, because the files never grow very large and because chimpanzees are very dextrous. So when a pygmy elephant trundles off, all the `puppy` requests are together in order from Auckland to Samoa, and the `robot` requests are together, also in order, and so on:

image::images/chimps_and_elves/bchm_0209.png[Secondary sort]

What Chimpanzee and Elephant do is incredibly clever. They achieve this secondary _grouping_ by simply _sorting_ the incoming records. Take a deck of cards, sort them by number, and fan them out in a line. You'll see that to group them by number now requires only the trivial act of separating piles where one number meets the next.

Chimpanzees place workforms in the file folder in sorted order by toy detail. Folders aren't very big, and are immediately adjacent to the chimp's dexterous fingers, this doesn't take amuch additional time.

As file folders are deposited next to each elf workstation, their toyforms are in order -- but of course there is no order across all the file folders: elephant A might have "apple-cheeked", "cabbage patch" and "yellow-haired" dolls, elephant B "malibu", "raggedy", and "yellow-haired", and elephant C only a tall stack of "real Armenian" dolls. That's no problem though. Each elephant holds its topmost workform at the ready, and passes it to the elves once it's the next one in order to be processed. So in this case, workforms would come from elephant A, then A again, then B, and so on.

image::images/chimps_and_elves/bchm_0210.png[Secondary sort]

Elves do not have the prodigious memory that elephants do, but they can easily keep track of the next few dozen work orders each elephant holds. That way there is very little time spent seeking out the next work order. Elves assemble toys as fast as their hammers can fly, and the toys come out in the order Santa needs to make little children happy.


// === Why it's efficient ===
// 
// Now it is still true that each elf workstation has incoming mail from every letter-reader. A constant stream of elephants are constantly dropping off order batches, some light, some heavy.
// 
// But the delivery isn't harum-scarum all-at-once, it's orderly and purposeful. If one workstation is slow, the elephants wait patiently -- the entire operation doesn't slow down. And most importantly, the task of reading each letter happens in parallel with the task of organizing the work requests. It's quite impressive.
