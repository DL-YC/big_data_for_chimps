=== Concerns ===

You should be doing exactly one of the following two things:

* thinking about shuffling abstract blobs of data around
* doing stuff to data, with no thought given as to how it will be shuffled around.

* connecting "the right way to think about it" to "the way it's gotta be"
* using the right-way-tothink-about-it, the right way.
