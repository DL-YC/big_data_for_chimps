=== Pointwise Mutual Information

[[pmi]]

Pointwise Mutual Information sounds like an Insurance holding company, but is in fact a simple way to expose signal from background.

Let's pick up the example from <<first_exploration>>

* rate the word 'barbecue' is used
* rate that words are used on grid cell 023130130
* rate the word 'barbecue' is used on grid cell 023130130

	pmi(x; y) := log[ p(x, y) / (p(x)*p(y))

	<math>
	\operatorname{pmi}(x;y) \equiv \log\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)} = \log\frac{p(x|y)}{p(x)} = \log\frac{p(y|x)}{p(y)}.
	</math>
