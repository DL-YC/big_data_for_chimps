== Chimpanzee and Elephant Save Christmas (ch. D) ==

It was holiday time at the North Pole, and letters from little boys and little girls all over the world flooded in as they always do. But this year there was a problem: the world had grown, and the elves just couldn't keep up with the scale of requests. Luckily, their friends at the Elephant & Chimpanzee Data Shipment Company were available to simplify the process.

=== A Non-scalable approach ===

To meet the wishes of children from every corner of the earth, each elf is capable of making any kind of toy, from Autobot to Pony to X-box.

As bags of mail arrived from all over, they were hung from the branches of a large Tree (known as the bag tree, or B.Tree for short.) Each time an elf was ready for the next letter from her region, a big claw arm swung out to the right spot on the B.Tree to retrieve it. Without locality of access (the elf covering Novosibirsk might be in line right behind the elf covering Cucamonga), letters could't be pulled from the tree any faster than the crane arm could move.

The hallways were clogged with frazzled elves running back and forth between their workbenches and the B.Tree. It almost seemed as if elves spent as much effort on the mechanics of retrieving letters as they did making toys.

=== Letters to Toy Requests ===

In place of this came the chimps and elephants, singing a rather bawdy version of the Map-Reduce Haiku, who built the following system.

As you might guess, they lined up a finite number of chimpanzees at typewriters to read each letter. Instead of sending the letter on directly, the chimp would fill out a work form for each requested toy, labelled prominently by the type of toy. Some examples:

        --------------------------------------         # Joe is clearly a good kid, and thoughtful for his sister. He will get a robot and his sister will get a doll.

        Deer SANTA                                     robot | type="optimus prime" recipient="Joe"
                                                       hat   | type="girls small"  recipient="Joe's sister Julia"
        I wood like an optimus prime robot
        and a hat for my sister julia

        I have been good this year

        love joe


        --------------------------------------          # Frank is a jerk. He will get coal.

        HEY SANTA I WANT A PONY AND NOT ANY             coal  | type="anthracite" recipient="Frank" reason="doesn't like to read"
        DUMB BOOKS THIS YEAR

        FRANK

        ---------------------------------------         # Spam, no action

        Greetings to you Mr Claus, I came to know
        of you in my search for a  reliable and
        reputable person to handle a very confidential
        business transaction, which involves the
        transfer of a huge sum of money...

=== Order Delivery ===

In the new system, each type of toy request is handled at the one workbench designated for that toy.  For example, all robots and model cars might go to workbench A, while ponies, coal and yo-yos went to workbench B.

Next to each chimpanzee stands a line of pygmy elephants, one for each workbench.
Once the chimp is done with a mailbag, those elephants march off, each to its addressed workbench. Behind them a new line of elephants trundle into place.

=== Toy Assembly ===

A station might handle several types of toys in a factory run, but it always sees them in a continuous batch (they will get all the robots, then all the model cars). This is of great help to the elves, as the set-up for tying ribbons on Ponies is very different from the set-up for gift-wrapping Quidditch Brooms.

The finished toys go into large sacks for santa to deliver.

=== Why it's efficient ===

Now it is still true that each elf workstation has incoming mail from every letter-reader. A constant stream of elephants are constantly dropping off order batches, some light, some heavy.

But the delivery isn't harum-scarum all-at-once, it's orderly and purposeful. If one workstation is slow, the elephants wait patiently -- it doesn't slow down the entire operation. And most importantly, all the work of organizing the work requests happens in parallel with reading the letters. It's pretty impressive.
