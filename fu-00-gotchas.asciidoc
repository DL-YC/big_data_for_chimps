== Gotchas ==


* Hadoop commandline tools use the trash to delete items; programs using the hadoop API do not. <remark>verify Pig uses the trash</remark>

* The tasktracker heap size does not impact the amount of memory available for your tasks. You must adjust `mapred.map.child.java.opts` or `mapred.reduce.child.java.opts`.

* Stripe your data across all disks
  - Don't use the root drive
  - Don't RAID your disks


* Don't hit external services -- see <<server_logs_ddos>>.


== Tips ==


* Remove files from the trash immediately with `hadoop fs -rm -skipTrash /users/(you)/.Trash`
