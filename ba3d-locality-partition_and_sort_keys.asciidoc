=== Partition Key and Sort Key ===

the Elves' system is meant to evoke the liabilities of database and worker-queue based systems:

* setup and teardown of workstation == using latency code for a throughput process
  - running the same code in a tight loop makes life easy for the CPU cache in low level languages...
  - and makes it easy for the interpreter in high-level languages, especially JIT 
* swinging the mail claw out to retrieve next work order == latency of seek on disk

* chimpanzees are dextrous == processing sorted data in RAM is very fast

* elves pull work orders in sequence: The chimpanzees call this a "merge sort", and the elves' memory a "sort buffer"
