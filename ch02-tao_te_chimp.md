* Humans are important, robots are cheap
  - Optimize first, and typically only, for Joy
  - Automate out of boredom or terror, never efficiency.
  - Readable code is maintainable code.

* Simplicity yields Scalability, Scalability yields Efficiency
  - don't worry about writing performant code: write scalable code
  - If you can decouple, do.
  
* Never solve hard problems. Turn them in to easy problem and solve those instead.
  - simple algorithm and lots of data beats clever algorithm and less data
  - great artists steal
