* Raw data, as it comes from the source. This could be unstructured (lines of text,
* Source domain models:
* Target domain models:
* Transformer:

You'll be tempted to move code too far to the right -- to put transformation code into
Resist the urge. At the beginning of the project you're thinking about the details of extracting the data, and possibly still puzzling out the shape of the target domain models.
Make the source domain models match the raw data as closely as reasonable, doing only the minimum effective work to make the data active.

Separate the model's _properties_ (fundamental intrinsic data), its _metadata_ (details of processing), and its _derived variables_ (derived values).
