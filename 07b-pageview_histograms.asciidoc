=== Pageview Histograms ===

Let's start exploring the dataset. Andy Baio

We want to group on `date_hr`, so just add a 'virtual accessor' -- a method that behaves like an attribute but derives its value from another field:

----
include::code/serverlogs/logline-00-model-date_hr.rb[]
----

This is the advantage of having a model and not just a passive sack of data.

Run it in map mode:

----
include::code/serverlogs/logline-02-histograms-02-mapper-wu-lign-sort.log[]
----

TODO: digression about `wu-lign`.

Sort and save the map output; then write and debug your reducer.

----
include::code/serverlogs/logline-02-histograms-full.rb[]
----

When things are working, this is what you'll see. Notice that the `.../Star_Wars_Kid.wmv` file already have five times the pageviews as the site root (`/`).

----
include::code/serverlogs/logline-02-histograms-03-reduce.log[]
----

You're ready to run the script in the cloud! Fire it off and you'll see dozens of workers start processing the data.
